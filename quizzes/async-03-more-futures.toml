Given a function `sleep(d)` that sleeps for the given duration, consider this function:

```rust
let futs: Vec<_> = [1, 2, 3].iter().map(|n| async move {
  sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
  n + 1
}).collect();

for fut in futs {
  let n = fut.await;
  println!("{n}");
}
```

When executed, about how many seconds should this take to execute?

Without using a function like `join_all`, the futures will not run concurrently. Therefore this code would take 15 seconds (5 seconds per list element).

Say you are designing a utility function with the following specification:

> where the outputs can be converted to strings.
> `map_stringify` returns a vector of stringified outputs.

Which function type signature best encodes this specification?
